# English School - HW
## My favorite day

Friday is my favorite day of the week, because it's the last work day of the week before of the weekend.

On Fridays, I get up early and has a shower. After that, I have breakfast.

For lunch, I head to a cafe with my friends or colleagues. We chat and laugh over a meal. After that we walk in the park.

In the evening, I go out for dinner with my family or stay in and watch a movie. Sometimes, I read a book or play to computer games. From morning until night, Fridays are filled with joy and relaxation.
